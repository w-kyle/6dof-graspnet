#Notes on instalation on Colin's Desktop
Had to install CUDA 10.0, or there are errors when you try to compile and run examples

I need CUDA 10.2 for other stuff, so I installed alongside using a runfile install
When prompted I did not add the driver for 10.0 (you need to most recent one for 10.2)
I did not change the CUDA shortcut folder in usr/local/bin (it still points to 10.2)
I did not select the option to add the cuda directory to the path
Instead, I made a Python 2 virtual environment, and modified the activate script to load the environment variables (and unload them properly). 
Those changes are as follows


Other changest to the standard install directions
had to install a lower version of mayavi that supports python 2.7
had to sudo apt install Rtree dependendency

#multi gpu errors
modified point net
pointnet2/tf_ops/sampling/tf_sampling.py line 64 from:
    with tf.device('/gpu:1'):
to:
    with tf.device('/gpu:0'):

#hardcoded to use GPU 1 but I only have GPU 0?

#had to make the checkpoints folder, does not exist by git default
#need to add all checkpoint folders from the drive link

#my gpu is not recognized correctly by default. 
#for some reason I had to add a line to get it to use the GPU
Added "tf.test.is_gpu_available()" to the beginning of the main demo file, line 24
